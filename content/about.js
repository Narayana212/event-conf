technological revolution. It has four Schools, viz., Engineering,
Natural Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, Management &
Entrepreneurship, and the Academy of Continuing Education. We were the
first university in the country to offer a 4-year multidisciplinary
research degree. Today, we are continuing as trailblazers with new
kinds of curriculum, championed by faculty drawn from some of the top
institutions in the country and the world. With low faculty-student
